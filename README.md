In various situations the SkyAPM shall hold a vote. These votes can happen on the phone, email, or via a voting service, when appropriate. Voters can either respond "agree, yes, +1", "disagree, no, -1", or "abstain". A vote passes with two-thirds vote of votes cast. An abstain vote equals not voting at all.

# History
吴晟, Sheng Wu [@wu-sheng](https://github.com/wu-sheng) created SkyWalking main repositories(including UI) at Oct. 2015. And contributed this project to the OpenSkywalking Organization at 2017. At 2019, the org rename to **SkyAPM** to avoid branding issue, because SkyWalking now is the project, logo and brand of Apache Software Foundation. 

**SkyWalking's formal two major repositories have been contributed to and accepted by [Apache Software Foundation](https://github.com/apache).**

Now, **SkyWalking is in Apache Incubator**, click [here](https://incubator.apache.org/projects/skywalking.html) for more details in ASF.
